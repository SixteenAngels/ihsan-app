## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### If you get "column does not exist" errors:
The script automatically adds all missing columns, so this should be resolved.

### If you get permission errors:
Make sure you're running the script as a database owner/admin in Supabase.

### If tables already exist:
The script uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` and `ALTER TABLE` statements, so it's safe to run multiple times.

## ðŸ“ž Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the Supabase logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify your environment variables are correct
3. Ensure you have the proper permissions in Supabase
4. The script includes detailed logging to help identify issues
